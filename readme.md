# DSA in JavaScript

This repository contains my solutions to basic **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems implemented in **JavaScript**. The repository is organized into various folders representing different types of problems and data structure implementations. I will continue to add more categories as I progress.

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to practicing and solving **DSA problems** using JavaScript. It will be continuously updated with solutions for a variety of algorithms and data structures, starting from basic problems and expanding to more complex topics like arrays and stack implementations. The repository includes both basic problems and popular problems from platforms like **Leetcode**.

### Topics Covered:
- Basic DSA Problems
- Arrays (with basic and Leetcode problems)
- Stack (with implementations and problems)

## Folder Structure

### Folder Breakdown:
- **basic-problems**: This folder contains simple algorithm problems such as string reversal, palindrome checking, and other fundamental exercises.
- **arrays**: This folder includes both basic array problems (like finding maximum, removing duplicates) and Leetcode problems.
- **stack**: The folder contains stack implementations and problems that can be solved using a stack, such as balancing parentheses.
